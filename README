Template/Declare/Bricolage version 0.01
=======================================

This module provides Template::Declare-based tools to simplify the generation
of XML documents for use with the Bricolage SOAP API. If you need to generate
XML files to send to Bricolage, this is the library to make your life easier.
If you don't use Bricolage, well, you don't need this library. But see
Template::Declare itself for a nice, Perlish templating environment.a
